## Overview

The open source project I chose is called **Word Cloud** which is a python program which generates a visual representation of words based on frequency. The creator's name is Andy, he has a blog which he titles "Andy's Computer Vision and Machine Learning Blog". 

The link can be found [here](peekaboo-vision.blogspot.ca).

In Andy's readme, he mentions that this software is used by a bot on reddit, to generate word clouds of submission histories and comments on request from any user. For similar purposes, the word cloud software is also used by a Twitter bot to generate word clouds of tweets. Finally, the word cloud software is also used by a program for Twitch.tv called "Chatstats". I chose this software because the idea is quite simple and the pictures it generates are quite visually pleasing.
